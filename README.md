# LearnWiseLang

The LearnWiseLang Platform is an innovative AI-powered solution designed to
enhance English language proficiency among college students. The platform
leverages speech recognition technology to provide real-time feedback on
pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary usage, enabling users to improve their
communication skills effectively. It features three core functionalities: a mock
interview questionnaire tailored to each user's resume, a speech analyzer for assessing
spoken English, and written English tests to enhance language fluency.
The platformâ€™s AI-generated feedback helps users identify and correct common
language errors, boosts confidence, and fosters the ability to express ideas clearly
across a range of topics. In addition, it provides vocabulary-building exercises to
expand users' lexicons. By integrating the MERN stack for a robust and scalable web
solution, the LearnWiseLang Learning Platform offers an accessible, user-friendly interface
that facilitates continuous language improvement. This project aims to empower
students to overcome language barriers, prepare for professional environments, and
build confidence in their English communication skills for both academic and
professional success.
